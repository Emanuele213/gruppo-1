##### Create a terminal based app that manage bookings in an hotel. We could manage rooms, peoples and bookings. For each room we would like to know which guests are in that room on daily base. We can manage peoples, rooms and booking (insert, update, delete and basic search). We can also search by room and day which guests are staying in a room.
